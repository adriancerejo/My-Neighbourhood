# My-Neighbourhood -- In the process of creating the React version of the web app
## About:
Provides information based on user location and allows the user to search other places around the world.

## Features:
- Map of local area
- Current weather
- 7 day forecast
- News articles

## Issues:
- Finding a news api was difficult, however the one I did find only provides national news rather than local news
- Some news articles do not have an image associated with them resulting in a broken img link
- News from foreign countries are in their native language (Germany - german, Russian - russian)

## Requirements:
- Location needs to be enabled
- API Keys from the following:
  - OpenCageData (Map)
  - DarkSky (Weather)
  - NewsAPI
 
## To Add (Maybe):
- [ ] Translation of foreign language into english - trying this in new react version
- [ ] Refactoring code (weather one is messy)
- [X] Make webpage responsive (kind of - I tried my best)
